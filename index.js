  body: "221223 Christmas is coming but I have nothing to do. I don\u0026rsquo;t have any plans or events to attend and I\u0026rsquo;m feeling a bit down about it. I know the holiday is about spending time with loved ones, but with the pandemic still raging on, it\u0026rsquo;s hard to feel the holiday cheer this year. I\u0026rsquo;m trying to stay positive and focus on the things I\u0026rsquo;m grateful for, but it\u0026rsquo;s tough. On a brighter note, I switched my hosting service from Vercel to github.io because Vercel was just too slow for my liking. I\u0026rsquo;ve been really happy with the switch so far and the site is loading much faster. It\u0026rsquo;s the little things, right? In other news, I\u0026rsquo;ve been struggling with chronic sleep deprivation lately. It\u0026rsquo;s been a constant battle and I\u0026rsquo;m having a hard time getting enough rest. I\u0026rsquo;ve tried everything from setting a consistent bedtime to drinking chamomile tea before bed, but nothing seems to be working. It\u0026rsquo;s frustrating and I\u0026rsquo;m feeling pretty drained as a result. On a positive note, I\u0026rsquo;ve been doing a mini digital detox lately where I use the internet but don\u0026rsquo;t use social media. It\u0026rsquo;s been going really well so far and I\u0026rsquo;ve been able to focus more on other things. It\u0026rsquo;s been a nice break from the constant notifications and I\u0026rsquo;ve been able to get a lot more done as a result. Speaking of the internet, I\u0026rsquo;ve noticed a weird trend recently of people using the emoji ðŸ’€ to mean \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m dead\u0026rdquo;, meaning laughed too hard. I find it a bit morbid, but that\u0026rsquo;s what I like. Relatively decent movement on the internet in a while. Overall, it\u0026rsquo;s been a bit of a mixed bag lately. Some good, some not so good. But I\u0026rsquo;m trying to stay positive and focus on the things that are going well."
