  "body": "Tarotic Introduction Tarotic is a small conlang with around 150 words. The core of Tarotic is a set of 22 essential words, based on the Major Arcana of Tarot. These words are usually used as adjectives, but can sometimes be used as another part of speech. Each of these words represents a concept associated with its corresponding Major Arcana, and their spellings are derived from various languages, such as Latin, Arabic, Slavic, and Russian. The language is called Tarotic because it is based on the Tarot Cards. Concept Overall, Tarotic is a unique and creative conlang with a rich system of words and grammar based on the concepts of the Tarot. While it may have a small lexicon, each word is multifunctional and has a strong connection to its corresponding Major Arcana. Phonetics Tarotic has five vowels: Vowel Pronunciation a /a/ e /e/ i /i/ o /o/ u /u/ Tarotic also has the following consonants: Consonant Pronunciation s /s/ w /w/ l,r /l/ f,v /f/ g /g/ h /h/ k,c /k/ j /j/ n /n/ m /m/ b /b/ p /p/ z /z/ x /ks/ sh /ʃ/ Grammar Word Order Tarotic is a verb-second language, similar to German and Dutch, which means that the verb is usually placed in the second position in a sentence. In Tarotic, the last-used verb is always placed at the end of the sentence. The word order for noun phrases is also strict, with the modifier (adjective) always coming before the noun it modifies. The basic sentence structure in Tarotic is as follows: Speaker-verb-direct object-indirect object-[verb2]\u0026hellip; Nouns Nouns that do not end with -o for some reason should be capitalized(including pronouns). Adjectives Tarotic is also a postpositive adjective language, which means that adjectives are placed after the nouns they modify. To avoid confusion, restrictive adjectives should always be connected to the nouns they modify with a hyphen. For example: \u0026ldquo;The strong man\u0026rdquo; would be translated as \u0026ldquo;Nere-forna orano\u0026rdquo; in Tarotic. Verbs Verbs in Tarotic are indicated by the ending vowel -e. The final verb in a sentence must end with -n. Tarotic has a small set of basic words, such as \u0026ldquo;to eat\u0026rdquo; (\u0026ldquo;make\u0026rdquo;), \u0026ldquo;to say\u0026rdquo; (\u0026ldquo;sire\u0026rdquo;), \u0026ldquo;to think\u0026rdquo; (\u0026ldquo;sape\u0026rdquo;), \u0026ldquo;to love\u0026rdquo; (\u0026ldquo;habe\u0026rdquo;), \u0026ldquo;to go\u0026rdquo; (\u0026ldquo;kolese\u0026rdquo;), and \u0026ldquo;to be strong\u0026rdquo; (\u0026ldquo;forne\u0026rdquo;). These words may be derived from the 22 essential words. Contexts Tarotic does not have an objective case for pronouns, so context is used to determine their function in a sentence. That-clause That-clause can be described with Vu. For example: I need a book that is written in Tarotic. / Ame note asefiro vu sude de Tarotic mean.(literal: I need a book that is of Tarotic) You can use Vu for any noun, be it a person or an object. However, you must use the word \u0026ldquo;mean\u0026rdquo; to close the that-clause to clearly indicate the end of the clause. Feelings In Tarotic, all feelings are described in a very simple way. They can be described with only two elements: \u0026ldquo;positive/negative\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;firece/temperate\u0026rdquo;. Positive and fierce: havulo (habi+vulk) Positive and temperate: halico (habi+salic) Negative and firece: mevulo (mesi+vulk) Negative and temperate: melico (mesi+salic) Part-of-speech Transformation The part of speech of a word in Tarotic can be modified by adding a certain vowel to the end: Vowel Part of Speech -a adjective -e verb -o noun -i adverb -u others There are some exceptions to this rule, such as pronouns, which do not change their form. Pronouns Tarotic is a synthetic language, meaning that words do not conjugate based on pronouns. Instead, pronouns are used in their stem form and their function is determined by context. Pronouns in Tarotic are: Person Singular Plural First Ame Amen Second Ze Zem Third(person, genderless) Ore Orem He Nere Nerem She Mare Marem Third(object) Se Sem neb and maka can be used to represent manliness or femininity. Nebore=he, Makore=she\u0026hellip; Shortening, Nere/Mare. Arcanics Tarotic has a small but multifunctional vocabulary, with many of the words derived from various languages and connected to the concepts represented by their corresponding Major Arcana. They are called Arcanics.

  "body": "Agree to Disagree 平和的に争いを終わらせるたった一つの方法 AIと何度も議論を重ねてきて、気づいたことが在る。「agree to disagree」という言葉の魔力である。日本ではあまり聞かないフレーズだが、「お互いの意見が違うということを認め、それらを尊重し、而して正しいとは認めず、二度とこの件について話し合わない」というステイルメイトへ持っていくための言葉である。私はこの言葉こそが争いを集結させる鍵ではないかと思い始めている。 無論、危険だ。要するに日本における「人それぞれ砲」と同義である。「人それぞれ」という言葉を使った時点でそれは議論の放棄であり、相互理解の放棄であり、戦争こそ免れど理解し合うことは永久にない。個人主義であり、国家主義であり、「和を以て貴しとなす」ことの対極のようにも見える。しかしagree to disagreeに関しては、実はわずかに「人それぞれ砲」よりも優れている。そしてこのわずかな秀抜が非常に大きな意味を持つのだ。 それは、agree to disagreeを行うためには「相互の同意」が必要であるということである。\u0026ldquo;お互い\u0026quot;が、ああ俺らはわかりあえないね、もうこの話はやめにしよう、と合意しなければ至らない。この点で「人それぞれ」とは全く異なる。なぜなら人それぞれ砲を成立させるためにはたったひとりの意思があればいいのだ。ぶっ放せば、終わり。合意など必要ない。一方的に会話を打ち切ることができる。 しかしagree to disagreeは、どちらか片方がそれを拒絶した場合成立しなくなる。この点が非常に大きい。それは裏を返せば、これが成立するならばその瞬間、この一点においては相互の尊重が生まれている。このほんの僅かな「リスペクト」が、起きていた争いやその後の遺恨を非常に巧く緩和してくれる。agree to disagreeは、「お前の意見そのものにこそ同意しないが、お前がその意見を持つという意思や権利は認める」という意思表示だからである。これは単なる議論の打ち切りではない。真なる意味での「尊重」であり、ともすれば「相互理解」である。 これは答えの出ない議論で水掛け論や感情論に発展してしまった時などに特に有用である。概して実に欧米らしい考え方といえよう。個人主義のメリットが際立った一例である。一部の辞書ではこれをan act of tolerationと形容していた。そう考えるとやはり私の処世術として適している。"

That does not mean I necessarily dislike her; in fact, everyone in this masterpiece is so amiable and lovable. It\u0026rsquo;s just that she does not stand out comparatively. However, it is worth noting that the creators seem to be very well aware of their character\u0026rsquo;s personality. It is on a whole and is not limited to Meguru, but still, I am surprised the most by how profound their understanding to her is. They know exactly what the player might think, and Shuji on behalf of the developers points it out in a dialogue every now and then. The clumsiness of her way to get intimate is frighteningly so accurate that I suspect they legit hired some real introvert for proofreading. On the other hand, I still struggle to understand her true nature sometimes. She seems to be an open book at first glance(in a meta sense; I know she is depicted as a close-minded person, but all the more that makes it easier for us to comprehend her true color, at least in theory), but is actually one of the most cryptic characters in my view. Unlike Nene and Tsumugi, she is not a witch(afaik) and does not have a strong and concealed wish in particular. She is also not an orphan or in any severe difficulty in terms of the surrounding environment. Finally, she is not the protagonist\u0026rsquo;s old friend or anything at the beginning, just a mere junior of him. Meguru has barely a ghostly concept of her whole life to delve into until chapter 6. While it may depend on how long her route is going to take, I am still wandering in the mist of the character named Meguru at the moment. Also, although this is completely my personal matter, I find no fun when it comes to the Monster Hunter thing. I don\u0026rsquo;t like that game at all. I understand that it is probably the only plausible way for her to approach Shuji and may be in character, but still I feel like it is a bit off the whole idiosyncrasy of Sabbat of the Witch and that one of the staffs was obsessed with MH and decided to cram it into their creation\u0026hellip; And probably that\u0026rsquo;s right. This game sometimes gets personal in this way. The band part was also a bit too in detail, so probably there was that one staff who has dedicated their school life to it. Not saying it was necessarily undesirable though, especially in Wakana route. 全体 エロパートに「匂い」というワードがめちゃくちゃ頻出する癖に実際に嗅ぐような描写が希薄なのかなりイラつくぜ。一回しかちゃんと嗅いでないよ。"

I\u0026rsquo;m trying to stay positive and focus on the things I\u0026rsquo;m grateful for, but it\u0026rsquo;s tough. On a brighter note, I switched my hosting service from Vercel to github.io because Vercel was just too slow for my liking. I\u0026rsquo;ve been really happy with the switch so far and the site is loading much faster. It\u0026rsquo;s the little things, right? In other news, I\u0026rsquo;ve been struggling with chronic sleep deprivation lately. It\u0026rsquo;s been a constant battle and I\u0026rsquo;m having a hard time getting enough rest. I\u0026rsquo;ve tried everything from setting a consistent bedtime to drinking chamomile tea before bed, but nothing seems to be working. It\u0026rsquo;s frustrating and I\u0026rsquo;m feeling pretty drained as a result. On a positive note, I\u0026rsquo;ve been doing a mini digital detox lately where I use the internet but don\u0026rsquo;t use social media. It\u0026rsquo;s been going really well so far and I\u0026rsquo;ve been able to focus more on other things. It\u0026rsquo;s been a nice break from the constant notifications and I\u0026rsquo;ve been able to get a lot more done as a result. Speaking of the internet, I\u0026rsquo;ve noticed a weird trend recently of people using the emoji 💀 to mean \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m dead\u0026rdquo;, meaning laughed too hard. I find it a bit morbid, but that\u0026rsquo;s what I like. Relatively decent movement on the internet in a while. Overall, it\u0026rsquo;s been a bit of a mixed bag lately. Some good, some not so good. But I\u0026rsquo;m trying to stay positive and focus on the things that are going well."
