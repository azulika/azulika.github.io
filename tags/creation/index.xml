      <description>Introduction Tarotic is a small conlang with around 150 words. The core of Tarotic is a set of 22 essential words, based on the Major Arcana of Tarot. These words are usually used as adjectives, but can sometimes be used as another part of speech. Each of these words represents a concept associated with its corresponding Major Arcana, and their spellings are derived from various languages, such as Latin, Arabic, Slavic, and Russian.</description>
