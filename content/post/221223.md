Christmas is coming but I have nothing to do. I don't have any plans or events to attend and I'm feeling a bit down about it. I know the holiday is about spending time with loved ones, but with the pandemic still raging on, it's hard to feel the holiday cheer this year. I'm trying to stay positive and focus on the things I'm grateful for, but it's tough.

On a brighter note, I switched my hosting service from Vercel to github.io because Vercel was just too slow for my liking. I've been really happy with the switch so far and the site is loading much faster. It's the little things, right?

In other news, I've been struggling with chronic sleep deprivation lately. It's been a constant battle and I'm having a hard time getting enough rest. I've tried everything from setting a consistent bedtime to drinking chamomile tea before bed, but nothing seems to be working. It's frustrating and I'm feeling pretty drained as a result.

On a positive note, I've been doing a mini digital detox lately where I use the internet but don't use social media. It's been going really well so far and I've been able to focus more on other things. It's been a nice break from the constant notifications and I've been able to get a lot more done as a result.


Speaking of the internet, I've noticed a weird trend recently of people using the emoji ðŸ’€ to mean "I'm dead", meaning laughed too hard. I find it a bit morbid, but that's what I like. Relatively decent movement on the internet in a while.

Overall, it's been a bit of a mixed bag lately. Some good, some not so good. But I'm trying to stay positive and focus on the things that are going well.
