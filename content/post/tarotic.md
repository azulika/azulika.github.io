## Introduction

Tarotic is a small conlang with around 150 words. The core of Tarotic is a set of 22 essential words, based on the Major Arcana of Tarot. These words are usually used as adjectives, but can sometimes be used as another part of speech. Each of these words represents a concept associated with its corresponding Major Arcana, and their spellings are derived from various languages, such as Latin, Arabic, Slavic, and Russian.
The language is called Tarotic because it is based on the Tarot Cards.

> It is difficult to determine an exact number of words that are needed for a language to be communicable, as it depends on the specific context and goals of the communication. However, research has shown that a vocabulary of around 2,500 words is sufficient for basic communication in English, and a vocabulary of around 6,000 words is sufficient for general proficiency. 

### Concept
Overall, Tarotic is a unique and creative conlang with a rich system of words and grammar based on the concepts of the Tarot. While it may have a small lexicon, each word is multifunctional and has a strong connection to its corresponding Major Arcana.

## Phonetics

Tarotic has five vowels:

| Vowel | Pronunciation |
| ----- | ------------- |
| a     | /a/           |
| e     | /e/           |
| i     | /i/           |
| o     | /o/           |
| u     | /u/           |

Tarotic also has the following consonants:

| w         | /w/           |

| z         | /z/           |
| x         | /ks/          |
| sh        | /ʃ/           |

## Grammar

### Word Order

Tarotic is a verb-second language, similar to German and Dutch, which means that the verb is usually placed in the second position in a sentence.  In Tarotic, the last-used verb is always placed at the end of the sentence. The word order for noun phrases is also strict, with the modifier (adjective) always coming before the noun it modifies.
The basic sentence structure in Tarotic is as follows:

Speaker-verb-direct object-indirect object-[verb2]...

### Nouns

Nouns that do not end with -o for some reason should be capitalized(including pronouns).

### Adjectives 

Tarotic is also a postpositive adjective language, which means that adjectives are placed after the nouns they modify. To avoid confusion, restrictive adjectives should always be connected to the nouns they modify with a hyphen.
For example: "The strong man" would be translated as "Orano-fora" in Tarotic.

#### Compound word

While Tarotic is a postpositive language, sometimes there are certain words to which a restrictive adjective is adhered. For instance, *samilaro* is made up of sa(si as adjective) and milaro(living beings), hence a dead being. When it happens, it has an implication that the word's state described with the adjective is fixed and would never change. In the case of samilaro, a dead being would never come back alive.

#### Diaeresis

You may get confused where to put an adjective in this type of word:

- zemlo de diabo(the place of devil=office)

In short, you put an adjective directly next to the word you want to modify.

- zelmo-zala de diabo (the new place of devil=new office)
- zelmo de diabo-iba(the place of angel = spa, brothel, etc)

If you're uncertain where to put your adjective, you use so-called diaeresis to indicate that the adjective is attached to the whole word. To do this, you may modify the final vowel of the word.

- zelmo de diabo-fismä(deteriorated workplace)

When a diaeresis is added, the vowel becomes longer one (aa in this case).


### Verbs

Verbs in Tarotic are indicated by the ending vowel -e. The second verb in a clause must end with -n. Note that it is based on clause units, not sentences.

- Ame diabe maken.
- Ame make.
- Ame sape vu oram vu make maki mean asta sude (mean).

### Capitalization

Any capitalized word is automatically considered as a noun, regardless of its final vowel. 

### Contexts

Tarotic does not have an objective case for pronouns, so context is used to determine their function in a sentence.

### That-clause

That-clause can be described with Vu. For example:

- The book which is written in Tarotic is hers. / Asefiro vu de Tarotic sude mean sude de Mare.

You can use Vu for any noun, be it a person or an object. However, you must use the word "`mean`" to close the that-clause to clearly indicate the end of the clause. However, if there is no following sentence, you can omit the mean marker.

- I need a book that is written in Tarotic. / Ame diabe asefiro vu de Tarotic sude. (literal: I need a book that is of Tarotic)

#### Word order inversion

Just like Dutch, there occurs word order inversion in that-clause.

- The book is written in Tarotic. / Asefiro **sude** de Tarotic.
- I need a book that is written in Tarotic. / Ame diabe asefiro vu de Tarotic **sude**.

Note that this "sude" is the first verb in the clause, so it does not take -n form.

### Feelings

In Tarotic, all feelings are described in a very simple way. They can be described with only two elements: "positive/negative" and "firece/temperate".

- Positive and fierce: havulo (habi+vulk)
- Positive and temperate: halico (habi+salic)
- Negative and firece: mevulo (mesi+vulk)
- Negative and temperate: melico (mesi+salic)
  
 "temperate" can be interpreted as "moderate", and "subordinate". Subordinate emotions are made up of combination of core emotions. There is no fixed definition for them.[要検証]
 

### Part-of-speech Transformation

The part of speech of a word in Tarotic can be modified by adding a certain vowel to the end:

| Vowel | Part of Speech |
| ----- | -------------- |
| \-a   | adjective      |
| \-e   | verb           |
| \-o   | noun           |
| \-i   | adverb         |
| \-u   | others         |

There are some exceptions to this rule, such as pronouns, which do not change their form. 

### Pronouns

Tarotic is a synthetic language, meaning that words do not conjugate based on pronouns. Instead, pronouns are used in their stem form and their function is determined by context.  Pronouns in Tarotic are:

| Person                    | Singular | Plural |
| ------------------------- | -------- | ------ |
| First                     | Ame      | Amen   |
| Second                    | Ze       | Zem    |
| Third(person, genderless) | Ore      | Orem   |
| He                        | Kore     | Korem  |
| She                       | Mare     | Marem  |
| Third(object)             | Se       | Sem    |

> kor and maka can be used to represent manliness or femininity. Korore=he, Makore=she... Shortening, Kore/Mare.

### Arcanics

Tarotic has a small but multifunctional vocabulary, with many of the words derived from various languages and connected to the concepts represented by their corresponding Major Arcana. They are called Arcanics. Here are a few examples:

| Word   | Translation                             | Major Arcana         | Word Origin                                                                                                    |

### Interrogatives
Tarotic also has a set of interrogative words. These words are pronounced with a sound similar to "F," rather than the spelling "V."

| Word   | Meaning |
| ------ | ------- |
| Voru   | Who     |
| Vu     | What    |
| Volesu | Where   |
| Vudu   | When    |
| Votu   | Why     |
| Vebu   | How     |

#### Origin
"Who": "Voru" (using the pronoun for "he/she" to ask about a person)
"What": "Vu" (using the pronoun for "it" to ask about a thing or concept)
"Where": "Volesu" (using the word for "wheel" to suggest movement or location)
"When": "Vudu" (using the word for "fate" or "destiny" to suggest time or timing)
"Why": "Votu" (using the word for "need" or "want" to suggest motivation or purpose)
"How": "Vebu" (using the word for "cloud" to suggest ways or methods)

### Imperative 

You can make verbs imperative by simply changing its last vowel to -ore. For example:
Astore(aste+-ore): Look!

### -iba form

Adding -iba to a word negates its meaning. Surprisingly, you can use this to any part of speech! Although it is usually used to verbs and adjectives. Note that -iba does not make Arcanics reversed, but just simply negates its meaning.

- zelmo-iba: no place, nowhere
- aste-iba: unsee, cannot see
- fora-iba: weak


### Number System

Tarotic has a base-22 number system, using the 22 essential words as roots for numbers up to 22. 
It can count up to 21, with each number represented by adding "os" to the root form of the corresponding essential word. For example, 0 is "zalos" and 1 is "baxos".
To represent numbers larger than 22, they are simply combined, such as 23 being represented as "baxos-arcosa" (1+22).

- Ame make korano enmir/ I ate an apple (at some point in the past)

#### Perfect tense

### Undefined words and Apar form

As Tarotic's vocabulary is small, sometimes you may find yourself in a situation where you have no word to describe what you want to say in the language. In that case, you can use the **Apar-[Any Arcanic]** form. 
"Apar" is a marker word that can only be used in this format. It is derived from अपरिभाषित(aparibhaashit), meaning "undefined".
By using Apar-[Any Arcanic] form, you can theoretically represent anything in the world, albeit in an ambiguous manner.

- Apar-zala: something that is related to the concepts of The Fool.

Alternatively, you can just use foreign words if you feel confident that it can convey what you mean. However, you have to follow Tarotic phonetic rules in their spellings.

- Ame pune Hayashi Rais miremaken enmir. / I ate hayashi rice.

#### Some notable points
- in that-clause(Vu clause), word order inversion occurs just like in Dutch
- Sape and sude are like soy and estoy in Spanish. Both of rhemtcan be translated as "Am/Are/Is", but usage is slightly different
- Zale(to do) can also be used to show willingness. You might think of "diabe", but diabe is strongly connected to the idea of extravagance, so it cannot be used in that way
- Zalo de: thing to do. For example: zalo de kolamo=thing to write=homework
