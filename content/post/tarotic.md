## Introduction

Tarotic is a small conlang with around 150 words. The core of Tarotic is a set of 22 essential words, based on the Major Arcana of Tarot. These words are usually used as adjectives, but can sometimes be used as another part of speech. Each of these words represents a concept associated with its corresponding Major Arcana, and their spellings are derived from various languages, such as Latin, Arabic, Slavic, and Russian.
The language is called Tarotic because it is based on the Tarot Cards.

### Concept
Overall, Tarotic is a unique and creative conlang with a rich system of words and grammar based on the concepts of the Tarot. While it may have a small lexicon, each word is multifunctional and has a strong connection to its corresponding Major Arcana.

## Grammar

### Word Order

Tarotic is a verb-second language, similar to German and Dutch, which means that the verb is usually placed in the second position in a sentence.  In Tarotic, the last-used verb is always placed at the end of the sentence. The word order for noun phrases is also strict, with the modifier (adjective) always coming before the noun it modifies.
The basic sentence structure in Tarotic is as follows:

Speaker-verb-direct object-indirect object-[verb2]...

### Nouns

Nouns that do not end with -o for some reason should be capitalized(including pronouns).

### Adjectives 

Tarotic is also a postpositive adjective language, which means that adjectives are placed after the nouns they modify. To avoid confusion, restrictive adjectives should always be connected to the nouns they modify with a hyphen.
For example: "The strong man" would be translated as "Nere-forna orano" in Tarotic.

### Verbs

Verbs in Tarotic are indicated by the ending vowel -e. The final verb in a sentence must end with -n.
Tarotic has a small set of basic words, such as "to eat" ("make"), "to say" ("sire"), "to think" ("sape"), "to love" ("habe"), "to go" ("kolese"), and "to be strong" ("forne"). These words may be derived from the 22 essential words.

### Contexts

Tarotic does not have an objective case for pronouns, so context is used to determine their function in a sentence.

### That-clause

That-clause can be described with Vu. For example:

I need a book that is written in Tarotic. / Ame note asefiro vu sude de Tarotic mean.(literal: I need a book that is of Tarotic)

You can use Vu for any noun, be it a person or an object. However, you must use the word "mean" to close the that-clause to clearly indicate the end of the clause.

### Feelings

In Tarotic, all feelings are described in a very simple way. They can be described with only two elements: "positive/negative" and "firece/temperate".

- Positive and fierce: havulo (habi+vulk)
- Positive and temperate: halico (habi+salic)
- Negative and firece: mevulo (mesi+vulk)
- Negative and temperate: melico (mesi+salic)

### Part-of-speech Transformation

The part of speech of a word in Tarotic can be modified by adding a certain vowel to the end:

| Vowel | Part of Speech |
| ----- | -------------- |
| \-a   | adjective      |
| \-e   | verb           |
| \-o   | noun           |
| \-i   | adverb         |
| \-u   | others         |

There are some exceptions to this rule, such as pronouns, which do not change their form. 

### Pronouns

Tarotic is a synthetic language, meaning that words do not conjugate based on pronouns. Instead, pronouns are used in their stem form and their function is determined by context.  Pronouns in Tarotic are:

| Person                    | Singular | Plural |
| ------------------------- | -------- | ------ |
| First                     | Ame      | Amen   |
| Second                    | Ze       | Zem    |
| Third(person, genderless) | Ore      | Orem   |
| He                        | Nere     | Nerem  |
| She                       | Mare     | Marem  |
| Third(object)             | Se       | Sem    |

> neb and maka can be used to represent manliness or femininity. Nebore=he, Makore=she... Shortening, Nere/Mare.

### Arcanics
